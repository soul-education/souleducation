</p>
<p>I'm so glad I got ya hooked up on my drug<br>
  Everybody dance to the music<br>
  Are you feeling well now you caught this bug<br>
  Everybody dance to the music<br>
  Think last time I took an overdose<br>
  Come on dance to the music<br>
  Made me realise I came too close<br>
  I bet ya wished you'd danced to the music, music, music, music <br>
  Death can seem to bear no relevance,<br>
  Bet you wished you dance to the music<br>
  What you want to do is kill yourself<br>
  Still you don't dance to the music<br>
  I can look at you and hear your scream<br>
  Come on dance to the music<br>
  And you tell me that your needle's clean<br>
  Come on dance, dance </p>
<p>Come on now dance to the music<br>
  I need it. Need it. I need it<br>
  Repeat</p>
<p>Don't you get hooked up<br>
  'Cos music is the drug<br>
  Don't you get hooked up<br>
  Repeat<br>
