<p><font color="#00CC33"><b>Rapper's Delight</b></font></p>
<p>(The Sugarhill Gang)</p>
<p>I said a hip hop,<br>
  Hippie to the hippie,<br>
  The hip, hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it<br>
  To the bang bang boogie, say, up jump the boogie,<br>
  To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat.<br>
  Now, what you hear is not a test - I'm rappin' to the beat,<br>
  And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet.<br>
  See, I am Wonder Mike, and I'd like to say hello,<br>
  To the black, to the white, the red and the brown,<br>
  The purple and yellow. But first, I gotta<br>
  Bang bang, the boogie to the boogie,<br>
  Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie,<br>
  Let's rock, you don't stop,<br>
  Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock.<br>
  Well so far you've heard my voice but I brought two friends along,<br>
  And the next on the mic is my man Hank,<br>
  C'mon, Hank, sing that song! </p>
<p>Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-A, the N-O-V-A,<br>
  And the rest is F-L-Y,<br>
  You see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix,<br>
  And these reasons I'll tell you why.<br>
  You see, I'm six foot one, and I'm tons of fun<br>
  When I dress to a T,<br>
  You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali<br>
  and I dress so viciously.<br>
  I got bodyguards, I got two big cars<br>
  That definitely ain't the wack,<br>
  I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunfoofed Cadillac.<br>
  So after school I take a dip in the pool,<br>
  Which is really on the wall,<br>
  I got a colour TV, so I can see<br>
  The Knicks play basketball. Hear me talk about<br>
  Checkbooks, credit cards, mo' money<br>
  Than a sucker could ever spend,<br>
  But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum form the Rucker<br>
  Not a dime 'til I made it again. Everybody go<br>
  Ho-tel, Mo-tel, Whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)<br>
  'Cos I'm a get a fly girl,<br>
  Gonna get some spank n' drive off in a def OJ. Everybody go<br>
  Ho-tel, Mo-tel, Holiday Inn,<br>
  Say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend.<br>
  Master Gee! My mellow!<br>
  It's on to you, so whatcha gonna do?</p>
<p>Well, it's on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,<br>
  The beat don't stop until the break of dawn.<br>
  I said M-A-S, T-E-R, a G with a double E,<br>
  I said I go by the unforgettable name<br>
  Of the man they call the Master Gee.<br>
  Well, my name is known all over the world<br>
  By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls.<br>
  I'm goin' down in history<br>
  As the baddest rapper there ever could be.<br>
  Now I'm feelin' the highs and you're feelin' the lows,<br>
  The beat starts gettin' into your toes<br>
  You start poppin' your fingers and stompin' your feet<br>
  And movin' your body while while you're sitting in your seat<br>
  And then damn! Ya start doin' the freak, I said<br>
  Damn! Right outta your seat<br>
  Then you throw your hands high in the air,<br>
  Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere<br>
  Ya rockin' to the beat without a care,<br>
  With the sureshot MCs for the affair.<br>
  Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang<br>
  But I rap to the beat just the same.<br>
  I got a little face, and a pair of brown eyes<br>
  All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize<br>
  Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,<br>
  The beat don't stop until the break of dawn<br>
  Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,<br>
  Like a hot buttered pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie<br>
  Pop da pop pop, don't you dare stop<br>
  Come alive y'all, gimme whatcha got<br>
  I guess by now you can take a hunch<br>
  And find that I am the baby of the bunch<br>
  But that's okay, I still keep in stride,<br>
  'Cos all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind<br>
  Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,<br>
  The beat don't stop until the break of dawn.<br>
  Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,<br>
  Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor<br>
  I'm gonna freak you here, I'm gona freak you there,<br>
  I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere.<br>
  'Cos I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind<br>
  I'll put TNT in your behind. I said<br>
  One, two, three, four, come on, girls, get on the floor<br>
  A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme whatcha got<br>
  'Cos I'm guaranteed to make you rock<br>
  I said one, two, three, four, tell me, Wonder Mike<br>
  What are you waiting for?</p>
<p>I said a hip hop,<br>
  The hippie to the hippie<br>
  The hip hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it<br>
  To the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie,<br>
  To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat.<br>
  A Skiddleebebop, we rock, scooby doo,<br>
  And guess what, America, we love you<br>
  'Cos you rocked and a rolled with so much soul,<br>
  You could rock 'til a hundred and one years old.<br>
  I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast,<br>
  But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast<br>
  Rock it up, Baby Bubba!<br>
  Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang da boogie<br>
  To the beat, beat, it's unique<br>
  Come on everybody and dance to the beat!</p>
<p>*Drum break*</p>
<p>A hip hop<br>
  The hippie to the hippie the<br>
  Hip hip a hop and you don't stop, rock it<br>
  Rock it out, Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang<br>
  The boogie to the boogie, the beat.<br>
  I said, I can't wait 'til the end of the week<br>
  When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat<br>
  And I attempt to raise your body heat.<br>
  Just blow your mind, so you can't speak<br>
  And do a thing but a-rock and shuffle your feet<br>
  And let it change up to a dance called the freak<br>
  And when you finally do come into your rhythmic beat,<br>
  Reast a little while so you don't get weak.<br>
  I know a man named Hank<br>
  He has more rhymes than a serious bank<br>
  So come on Hank, sing that song,<br>
  To the rhythm of the boogie, the bang bang da bong!</p>
<p>Well, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies' pimp,<br>
  The women fight for my delight.<br>
  But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs<br>
  That shock the house for the young ladies<br>
  And when you come inside, into the front,<br>
  You do the freak, spank, and do the bump<br>
  And when the sucker MC try to prove a point,<br>
  We're a treacherous trio, we're the serious joint!<br>
  a-From sun to sun and from time to time<br>
  I sit down and write a brand new rhyme<br>
  Because they say that miracles never cease<br>
  I've created a devastating masterpiece<br>
  I'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist,<br>
  Everybody, I say it goes like this<br>
  Well, I was walking home late one afternoon<br>
  A reporter stopped me for an interview<br>
  She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables<br>
  That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntable<br>
  This young reporter I did adore,<br>
  So I rocked some vicious rhymes like I never did before<br>
  She said, &quot;Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you<br>
  The Casanova legend must have been true&quot;<br>
  I said, &quot;By the way, baby, what's your name?&quot;<br>
  Said, &quot;I go by name of Lois Lane<br>
  And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can,<br>
  Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman.&quot;<br>
  I said, &quot;He's a fairy, I do suppose<br>
  Flyin' through the air in pantyhose<br>
  He may be very sexy, or even cute,<br>
  But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit,&quot;<br>
  I said, &quot;You need a man man who's got finesse<br>
  And his whole name across his chest<br>
  He may be able to fly all through the night,<br>
  But can he rock a party 'til the early light?<br>
  He can't satisfy you with his little worm,<br>
  But I can bust you out with my super sperm!&quot;<br>
  I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it.<br>
  An' I'm here an' I'm there, I'm Big Ban Hank, I'm everywhere<br>
  Just throw your hands up in the air<br>
  And party hardy like you just don't care<br>
  Let's do it, don't stop, y'all, a tick tock, y'all, you don't stop!<br>
  Go ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)<br>
  I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ,<br>
  Everybody go, &quot;Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn&quot;<br>
  You say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend<br>
  I say skip, dive, what can I say?<br>
  I can't fit 'em all inside my OJ,<br>
  So I just tak half, and bust 'em out,<br>
</p>
<p>I give the rest to Master Gee so he can shock the house<br>
  It was twelve o'clock one Friday night<br>
  I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right<br>
  Everybody was dancin' on the floor<br>
  Doin' all the things they never did before<br>
  And then this fly girl with a sexy lean<br>
  She came into the bar, she came into the scene<br>
  She travelled deeper inside the room<br>
  All the fellas checked out her white Sassoons<br>
  She came up to the table, looked into my eyes<br>
  Then she turned around and shook her behind<br>
  So I said to myself, it's time for me to release<br>
  My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece<br>
  And now people in the house, this is just for you<br>
  A little rap to make you boogaloo<br>
  Now the group you hear is called Phase Two<br>
  And let me tell you somethin', we're a helluva crew<br>
  Once a week, we're on the street<br>
  Just to cut in the jams and look at your feet<br>
  For you to party, you gotta have the moves,<br>
  So we'll get right down and get you a groove <br>
  For you to dance, you got to be hot<br>
  So we'll get right down and make you rock<br>
  Now the system's on and the girls are there<br>
  You definitely have a rockin' affair<br>
  But let me tell you somethin', there's still one fact<br>
  And to have a party, you got to have a rap<br>
  So when the party's over, you're makin' it home,<br>
  And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn<br>
  And while you're sleepin', you start to dream,<br>
  And thinkin' how you danced on the disco scene<br>
  My name appears in your mind,<br>
  Yeah, a name you know that was right on time<br>
  It was Phase Two just doin' a do<br>
  Rockin' you down 'cos you knew we could<br>
  To the rhythm of the beat that makes you freak,<br>
  Come alive girls, get on your feet<br>
  To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat<br>
  To the double beat beat that makes you freak<br>
  To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on<br>
  On'n'on into the break of dawn<br>
  Now I got a man comin' on right now<br>
  He's garuanteed to throw down<br>
  He goes by the name of Wonder Mike<br>
  Come on, Wonder Mike, do what you like!</p>
<p>I say a can of beer that's sweeter than honey,<br>
  Like a millionaire that has no money<br>
  Like a rainy day that is not wet,<br>
  Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet<br>
  Like Dracula without his fangs,<br>
  Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang<br>
  Like collard greens that don't taste good,<br>
  Like a tree that's not made out of wood<br>
  Like goin' up and not comin' down,<br>
  Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound<br>
  To the beat beat, you do the freak<br>
  Everybody just rock and dance to the beat<br>
  Have you ever went over a friends house to eat<br>
  And the food just ain't no good?<br>
  The macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed,<br>
  And the chicken tastes like wood<br>
  So you try to play it off like you think you can<br>
  By saying that you're full<br>
  And then your friend says, &quot;Mama, he's just being polite<br>
  He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!&quot;<br>
  So your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie<br>
  And you say that you already ate<br>
  And your friend says &quot;Man, there's plenty of food&quot;<br>
  So you pile some more on your plate<br>
  While the stinky food's steamin', your mind starts to dreamin'<br>
  Of the moment that it's time to leave<br>
  And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottin'<br>
  Into something that looks like cheese<br>
  Oh so you say &quot;That's it, I gotta leave this place<br>
  I don't care what these people think,<br>
  I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous<br>
  With this ugly food that stinks&quot;<br>
  So you bust out the door while it's still closed<br>
  Still sick from the food you ate<br>
  And then you run to the store for quick relief<br>
  From a bottle of Kaopectate<br>
  And then you call your friend two weeks later<br>
  To see how he has been<br>
  And he says, &quot;I understand about the food,<br>
  Baby Bubba, but we're still friends&quot;<br>
  With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie<br>
  The hip hip a hop, a you don't stop the rockin'<br>
  To the bang bang boogie<br>
  Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat<br>
  I say, &quot;Hank, can ya rock?<br>
  Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?<br>
  Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?&quot;<br>
  I said, &quot;Come on, make, make the people move!&quot;</p>
<p>I go to the balls and then ring the bell<br>
  Because I am the man with the clientele<br>
  And if ya ask me why I rock so well,<br>
  A Big Bang, I got clientele<br>
  And from the time I was only six years old<br>
  I never forgot what I was told<br>
  It was the best advice I ever had<br>
  It came from my wise, dear old dad<br>
  He said, &quot;Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you<br>
  And don't say a word until I'm through<br>
  Now there's a time to laugh, a time to cry<br>
  A time to live and a time to die<br>
  A time to break and a time to chill<br>
  To act civilized or act real ill<br>
  But whatever you do in your lifetime<br>
  You never let an MC steal your rhyme&quot;<br>
  So from six to six 'til this very day<br>
  I'll always remember what he had to say<br>
  So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style<br>
  I let them know that I'm versatile<br>
  I got style, finesse, and a little black book<br>
  That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look<br>
  But the thing that seperates you from me<br>
  And that is called originality<br>
  Because my rhymes are on from what you heard<br>
  I didn't even bite, not a go---word<br>
  And I say a little more, later on tonight<br>
  So the sucker MCs can bite all night<br>
  A tick a tock, y'all, a beat beat, y'all<br>
  A let's rock, y'all, you don't stop<br>
  Ya go, &quot;Ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today?&quot; (Say what?)<br>
  Ya say, &quot;I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and<br>
  Drive off in a def OJ&quot;<br>
  Everybody go, &quot;Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn&quot;<br>
  Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends<br>
  A like that, y'all, to the beat, y'all<br>
  Beat beat y'all, ya don't stop!<br>
  A Master Gee, my mellow<br>
  It's on to you so whatcha gonna do?</p>
<p>Well, like Johnny Carson on the Late Show<br>
  A like Frankie Crocker in stereo<br>
  Well like the Barkay's singin' &quot;Holy Ghost&quot;<br>
  The sounds to throw down, they're played the most<br>
  It's like my man Captain Sky<br>
  Whose name he earned with his super sperm<br>
  We rock and we don't stop<br>
  Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got<br>
  To the beat that it makes you freak<br>
  And come alive, girl, get on your feet<br>
  A like a Perry Mason without a case<br>
  Like Farrah Fawcett without her face<br>
  Like the Barkays on the mic<br>
  Like gettin' down right for you tonight<br>
  Like movin' your body so you don't know how<br>
  Right to the rhythm and throw down<br>
  Like comin' alive to the Master Gee<br>
  The brother who rocks so viciously<br>
  I said the age of one, my life begun<br>
  At the age of two I was doin' the do<br>
  At the age of three, it was you and me<br>
  Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee<br>
  At the age of four, I was on the floor<br>
  Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for<br>
  At the age of five I didn't take no jive<br>
  With the Master Gee it's all the way live<br>
  At the age of six I was a-pickin' up sticks<br>
  Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed<br>
  At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven<br>
  Don'tcha know I went off<br>
  I gotta run on down to the beat you see<br>
  Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls<br>
  Just take off their clothes to the beat the beat<br>
  To the double beat beat that makes you freak<br>
  At the age of eight, I was really great<br>
  'Cause every night, you see, I had a date<br>
  At the age of nine, I was right on time<br>
  'Cause every night I had a party rhyme<br>
  Going on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on<br>
  The beat don't stop until the break of dawn<br>
  A sayin' on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on<br>
  Like a hot buttered de pop pop de popcorn...</p>
