</p>
<p>I've been holding out so long <br>
  I've been sleeping all alone <br>
  Lord I miss you <br>
  I've been hanging on the phone <br>
  I've been sleeping all alone <br>
  I want to kiss you <br>
  Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh <br>

<p>Well, I've been haunted in my sleep <br>
  You've been starring in my dreams <br>
  Lord I miss you <br>
  I've been waiting in the hall <br>
  Been waiting on your call <br>
  When the phone rings <br>
  It's just some friends of mine that say, <br>
  &quot;Hey, what's the matter man? <br>
  We're gonna come around at twelve <br>
  With some Puerto Rican girls that are just dyin' to meet you. <br>
  We're gonna bring a case of wine <br>
  Hey, let's go mess and fool around <br>

  Won't you come on! Come on! </p>
<p>I've been walking in Central Park <br>
  Singing after dark <br>
  People think I'm crazy <br>
  I've been stumbling on my feet <br>
  Shuffling through the street <br>
  Asking people, &quot;What's the matter with you boy?&quot; </p>
<p>Sometimes I want to say to myself <br>
  Sometimes I say </p>
<p>Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh <br>
  Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh <br>
  Oooh oooh oooh </p>
<p>Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh <br>

<p>I guess I'm lying to myself <br>
  It's just you and no one else <br>
  Lord I won't miss you child <br>
  You've been blotting out my mind <br>
  Fooling on my time <br>
